# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/); this project is
pre-1.0, so APIs may still shift between minor versions.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

- Initial pre-release. `portage buy <url>` — native UCP discovery first,
  adapter fallback only when this process already has that platform's own
  credentials.
- `portage find --query "..."` — find UCP stores that stock something without
  knowing a URL, via an allowlist, DuckDuckGo, Brave, or a Google Programmable
  Search engine, then probe each candidate for `/.well-known/ucp` and search
  the survivors' catalogs. Probe results are cached in
  `~/.portage/discovery-cache.json`.
- `portage buy` with no URL runs that search and buys the offer you pick.
  `--yes` alone won't buy from a search result: the merchant has to be named by
  `--store` or an interactive pick.
- `portage buy --product-id ID` buys exactly that product instead of whatever
  the catalog search ranks first.
